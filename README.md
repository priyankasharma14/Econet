In order to help consumers and businesses alike select the correct bin for their trash, an image recognition algorithm is developed that will identify the nature of the trash, the recyclability, and the bin it belongs to, distinguishing it into 7 different classes which includes each about 500 images: non recyclable images, cardboard and paper, plastics, recyclable metal, glass, compostable waste, and other recyclables. This last category will inform the consumer that the item can be recycled but will need to be brought to a specific recycling facility (not put in the curbside bins).
Data Collection scripts - To collect data for different recyclable/non recyclable categories.
Econet_Final - model to categorize.
